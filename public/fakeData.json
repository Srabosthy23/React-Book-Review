        "review": "1984 is a chilling dystopian novel that explores the dangers of totalitarianism and the erosion of individual freedom. Set in a bleak future where the government monitors every aspect of citizens' lives, the story follows Winston Smith as he rebels against the oppressive regime of Big Brother. Orwell's vision of a surveillance state serves as a cautionary tale about the power of propaganda, thought control, and the manipulation of truth. With its stark portrayal of authoritarianism, 1984 remains a haunting reminder of the importance of preserving liberty and resisting tyranny.",
